The easiest way:

$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ../
$ make
$ make install

If the build fails because you're missing a dependency:

$ (Install any missing dependencies.)
$ make clean-all
$ cmake ../
$ make
$ make install


# Automation installer by V.Varbanovski @nu11secur1ty for Kali Linux 2019.4 - 1.01.2020
# https://www.nu11secur1ty.com/ > https://github.com/nu11secur1ty/Kali-Linux/tree/master/ettercap
# Execute the command into your terminal:

curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nu11secur1ty/Kali-Linux/master/ettercap/installer.sh | bash


#### Bundled libraries
Ettercap now bundles the following libraries with the source distribution:
  libnet 1.1.6
  curl 7.44.0
  luajit 2.0.4
  check 0.10.0


We will build bundled libraries that Ettercap depends upon, so you 
don't have to! 

By default, the build system will search for system-provided libraries. If it 
doesn't find the particular library it wants, it will build the library, itself.

# To disable the use of bundled libraries:
  $ cmake -DBUNDLED_LIBS=Off ../

# To disable the searching for system-provided libraries, and use 
# bundled libraries exclusively:
  $ cmake -DSYSTEM_LIBS=Off ../
