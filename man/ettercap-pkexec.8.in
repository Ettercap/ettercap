.SH NAME
ettercap\-pkexec \- graphical pkexec\-based launcher for ettercap

.br
This launcher depends on policykit\-1 and the menu packages, and basically wraps the
ettercap binary command
.br
with a pkexec action script usually defined on @POLKIT_DIR@/org.pkexec.ettercap.policy,
.br
allowing users to directly call ettercap from the desktop or menu launcher with root privileges.
.br
The commands available are exactly the same as the ettercap man page.

Please refer to man ettercap for the list of available parameters.
.br
(don't forget to change "ettercap" to "ettercap\-pkexec" as caller program).

example:
.Sp
ettercap\-pkexec \-G will start ettercap with root privileges and the GTK2 interface.

forwarded.

.SH PHILOLOGICAL HISTORY
"Even if blessed with a feeble intelligence, they are cruel and smart..."
this is the description of Ettercap, a monster of the RPG Advanced Dungeons & Dragon.
.PP
The name "ettercap" was chosen because it has an assonance with "ethercap" which
means "ethernet capture" (what ettercap actually does) and also because such
monsters have a powerful poison... and you know, arp poisoning... ;)

.SH Last words
"Programming today is a race between software engineers striving to build
bigger and better idiot\-proof programs, and the Universe trying to produce
bigger and better idiots. So far, the Universe is winning." \- Rich Cook
